  ## Purpose

  This module is designed to calculate an inflation rewards each years based on static params. Each block rewards is
  the same over the year.

  ### ðŸ§® Calculation

  The initial inflation is set to 15%, `annual_provisions` and `target_supply` will set at the beginning of the chain (on the first block).
  It's based on the initial total supply. For example, with a total supply of 200M token, annual_provisions will be configured to 30M and target_supply 230M.

  At the end of the year (the last block of the year, to be more precise), due to rounding imprecision, if the distributed
  tokens for the last block of the year added with the actual tokens total supply is bigger than the `target_supply`,
  only the difference to reach the `target_supply` will be minted. Conversely, in some case, due to rounding also,
  the `target_supply` is not reached at the last block, but at the next block.

  The new inflation, `annual_provisions` and `target_supply` is recalculated at the next block after the block that
  reach the `target_supply`. To calculate the new inflation, get the current inflation multiplied by (`1 - annual_reduction_factor`),
  then the new `annual_provisions` and `target_supply` is deducted based on the current total supply (that is the old `target_supply`)
