> `OKP4` is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed to enable communities to trustlessly share data, algorithms and resources to build the Dataverse - An open world where everybody can create or participate in custom ecosystems (with common governance mechanisms, sharing rules, business models...) to build a new generation of dApps way beyond Decentralized Finance.

## The protocol

`okp4d` is the node of the [OKP4](https://docs.okp4.network) network built on the [Cosmos SDK] üí´ & [Tendermint] consensus, and designed to become a hub of incentivized data providers, developers, data scientists & users collaborating to generate value from data and algorithms.

For a high-level overview of the OKP4 protocol and network economics, check out the [whitepaper](https://docs.okp4.network/docs/whitepaper/abstract).

## Developing & contributing

`okp4d` is written in [Go] and built using [Cosmos SDK].

### Prerequisites

- install [Go] `1.18+` following instructions from the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install);
- verify that [Docker] is properly installed and if not, follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com) for your environment;
- the project comes with a convenient `Makefile` so verify that [`make`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make) is properly installed.

### Build

To build the `okp4d` node, invoke the goal `build` of the `Makefile`:

```sh
make build
```

The binary will be generated under the folder `target/dist`.

## Supported platforms

The `okp4d` blockchain currently supports the following builds:

| **Platform** | **Arch** |         **Status**         |
|--------------|----------|:--------------------------:|
| Darwin       | amd64    |             ‚úÖ              |
| Darwin       | arm64    |             ‚úÖ              |
| Linux        | amd64    |             ‚úÖ              |
| Linux        | arm64    |             ‚úÖ              |
| Windows      | amd64    | Ô∏èüö´<br/> **Not supported** |

> Note: as the blockchain depends on [CosmWasm/wasmvm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm), we only support the targets
> supported by this project.

## Versioning

`okp4d` follows the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) to determine when and how the 
version changes.
